The Weather App allows users to check the current weather and hourly forecast for a given city. The app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the following information:

Current Weather: Temperature, weather description (e.g., "Clear Sky"), and an icon representing the weather condition.
Hourly Forecast: The weather forecast for the next 24 hours (in 3-hour intervals), including the temperature and corresponding weather icon.
